James Brown by Peter Shapiro

Call it the Muhammed Ali principle. If you talk up your own game as much as the Godfather of Soul, you've got to be one bad motherfucker. Listening to (and watching) James Brown walk it like he talks it with every glide, stride, and shimmy is the main pleasure of his music. There's a vicarious thrill to watching Mr. Dynamite camel-walk across a stage up to the mic to deliver one of his trademark grunts with precision timing. With James Brown, the tiniest gesture - a grunt, a shake of the head, an off the cuff vamp - meant everything. No one - not even Phil Spector or Trevor Horn - packed so much (timbres, forward motion, sparkle, intesnity) into each bar. Even when Brown started to economise in the 1970s, he always understood what made pop music great in the first place: an immediacy and momentum that streamrollered all obstacles. Brown was at once the most superficial musiciain in history and the most profound: there was nothing below the surface of his performances, yet his links to an ancient tradition with roots in the community musics of West and Central Africa are glaringly obvious. Moreover, Brown was the most assertively black personality ever to be accorded mainstream acceptance in America. His esteem in both African American and white communities was enough to have him courted by politicians such as Vice President Hubert Humphrey for his "Don't Be A Drop-out" campaign. On the day Martin Luther King was assassinated, television stations in cities with large black populations aired a live James Brown concert in the hope that it would prevent rioting; it worked. As with Louis Armstrong and Jimmy Rodgers it would be impossible to overstae his importance or overestimate his stature.

Moreover, unlike most legendary musical figures Brown's musical legacy has actually been treated with the respect it deserves. And it's a huge legacy. Not including side rpojects, he has at least 85 albums to his credit - not bad for a singles artist. For years Brown's best records languished in PolyGram's vaults, while disposable items such as Sex Machine Today (a 1975 attempt to recapture past glories) remained in curculation. Then the label placed Brown's catalogue in the hands of scholars and former associates like Cliff White, Harvey Weiner and Alan Leeds. They have subsequently produced a series of revelatory reissues that are landmarks of curatorial diligence and corporate largesse. 

James Brown
Live At the Apollo
Polydor CD 1990
(orig. King LP 1963)

James Brown was born in a shack on the outskirts of Barnwell, South Carolina on May 3rd, 1933. Dancing for pennies as a sideline to picking cotton in his adopted hometown of Augusta, Georgia, he was arrested for breaking into a car to steal a coat when he was 15 years old. Paroled in 1952, he joined lifelong sidekick Bobby Byrd's Gostpel Starlighters, who later changed their name toThe Flames and stepped into Little Richard's shoes when he got too big to play local dates. Bron's irrerpressible energy and acrobatics quickly garned The Flames a following, and their first single, "Please Please Please" (1956), eventually sold over a million copies.

Before going on to rewrite the rules about the role of rhythm in Western music, Mr. Please Please laid waste to the stnadard notion of a ballad singer. Like that other funky megalomaniac, George Clinton, Brown always wanted to be a crooner - in his fantasies he was a camel-walking cross between Louis Jordan and Billy Eckstine. Ray Charles may have brought the sound of gospel into R&B, but Brown brought into popular music the speaking-in-tongues possesion exhibited by such shouters as The Five Blind Boys Of Missisippi's Archie Brownlee an The Swan Silvertones' Claude Jeter.

The greatest moment, both artistically and historically, of Brown's early career was Live At The Apollo. Convinced that his fans would want a document of his electric live show, Brown approached King Records supremo Syd Nthan to record some dates at Harlem's Apollo Theatre. Nathan refused, but Brown went ahead, even paying for the recording himself. Shelved until May 1963, Live At The Apollo eventually hit number two on the American album charts. It is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant performances of Brown's incandescent career. Live At The Apollo is pure physicality transposed to vinyl: flash, coruscating motion, bravado, urgency. Despite the crowd noise, Brown is so absorbed in the magnificence of his performance, hearing it now is like spying on someone dancing in front of a bedroom mirror. The only problem with listening to Live At The Apollo, or any of his live albums, is how the crowd screaming alerts you to what you missed by not being there: Brown doing the mashed potato or good-footing it across the stage or throwing his cape off to come back to the mic one last time. Not only was Live At The Apollo a compercial and artistic triumph, but as a result of Brown's own finanacing and business acument, the album, along with Ray Charles's growing independence, became a high profile symbol of the viability of African American self-sufficiency. 

Foundations Of Funk - A Brand New Bag: 1964-1969
Polydor 2 x CD 1998

Beginning with Live At The Apollo, Brown embarked on an unparalleled period of world-changing activity that lasted until "Funky President (People It's Bad)" ended its R&B chart run at the end of 1974. During those 11 years, Brown singlehandedly (with some help from his group) orchestrated a tectonic shift in the foundation of music. Not unlike the compositional methods of Charles Minugs or Duke Ellington, Brown would sing and hum the song parts to bandleaders Nat Jones and Pee Wee Ellis, who would then transcribe them for the other musicians. Estranged from King over the Live At The Apollo affair, Brown adopted a holding pattern for the latter half of 1963 and the beginning of 1964, recording versions of "Caldonia" and "Things That I Used To Do" for Mercury subsidiary Smash. Then, in May, with newcomers such as saxophonists Maceo Parker and Nat Jones on board, Brown and his group recorded "Out Of Sight", which found a glorious middle ground between his screaming cover of The "5" Royales' "Think" and "Prisoner Of Love". With one ear tuned to the latest street slang and the other to Jesse Hill's 1960 proto-funk classic "Ooh Poo Pah Doo", Brown carfted a sinuous and sinewy groove that was as taut and lithe as his own dancing. 

"Out Of Sight" was light years away from the mainstream of black American music as defined by Sam Cooke and Motown, but nothing could have prepared the world for "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag". Its bone-rattling effect was largely due to the fact that the master tape was speeded up during post-production to give the record a claustrophobic feel. As a consequence, the blaring horns, piercing ghuitar and ricocheting rhythm section sound that much more intense. Brown reduces the entire gospel vocal tradition to flasetto shrieks and ugttural roars. But beyond the glare and flamboyance, "Papa" is also innovative: the 'chank' of the guitar part might well be the genesis of reggae. More significantly, the record upgraded the once anonymous instrumental bottom end to the be all and end all of music.

He followed "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" with the equally marvellous "I Got You (I Feel Good)", "Money Won't Change You" and "Let Yourself Go". The call-and-response interplay between guitarists Jimmy Nolen and Alphonso 'Country' Kellum and the horn section on the 1967 "Let Yourself Go" marks the moment when the guitar began to supplant the horns as the main instrumental focus in Brown's music. Nolen and Kellum were brought even further up front on the two records that triggered the shift away from soul towards funk: "Cold Sweat" and "There Was A Time". With the exception of the incomparably 'nastay' Dyke & The Blazers, nothing else at the time sounded quite like "Cold Sweat". On the record, Brown uses his voice as he uses his group - as a percussion instrument. The track features the catchiest horn hook ever; and during the "give the drummer some" interlude you can hear Clyde Stubblefield and bassist Bernard Odum inventing the next 30 years of music.

All of the above and a lot more are included on Foundations Of Funk. In addition to complete version of "The Popcorn", "I Got The Feeling", "You Got To Have A Mother For Me", and "Brother Rapp", this double CD contains "Ain't It Funky Now", "Say It Loud - I'm Black And I'm Proud", "funky Drummer" and a killer live version of "Out Of Sight / Bring It Up (Hipster's Avenue)" for which Brown summoned forth the greatest scream of his career. The highlight, however, is an unreleased take of "Cold Sweat", which gives a fascinating insight into his improvisational approach to composition. 

Sex Machine
Polydor CD 1998
(orig. King 2 x LP 1970)

On the cusp of the 1970s, as if in anticipation of Prog rock's tyranny over complex time signatures and chord changes, Brown and his assorted barbarian pipers burst through the gates of dawn and instigated an uprising aginst the concept of 'progressive'. The 1969 "Give It Up Or Turn It Loose" and "Ain't It Funky" are nothing more than vamps on single-horn licks, with Brown grunting the respective title phrases a few times.

With the exception of Bobby Byrd and drummers Jabo Starks and Clyde Stubblefield, Brown's entire group walked out in March 1970 over a pay dispute. They were replaced by a band of Cincinnati teenagers called The Pacesetters who used to hang around the King studios. Renamed The JBs, the group's core members were two brothers, bassist William 'Bootsy' and guitarist Phelps 'Catfish' Collins. Quickly recognising the Collins brothers as gifted rhythm players, Brown forever banished the horns to the background of his music. The first record cut with the new group was "Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine", which ranks alongside "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat" as one of Brown's most influential releases. Only two things matter about the record: Bootsy's bass, which has more popping, slithering, sliding, strutting gangster lean than a hustlers' convention on Lennox Avenue, and Catfish's tersely angular chicken-scratch guitar. With Jabo Starks's minimal drum part for company, the tension built up by the liquid bass and rawboned guitar is staggering. After recording the nearly as good "Super Bad", The JBs rerecorded "Sex Machine" and simulated a medley of "Bewildereed / I Got The Feelin' / Give It Up Or Turn It Loose" for a 'live' double album that was originally going to be titled James Brown At Home With His Bad Self. The album was eventually released with the title Sex Machine. Much of it was indeed legitimate live material recorded with Brown's 1969 group in Georgia, but it is The JBs' material, overdubbed with audience noise, that steals the show. The new version of "Sex Machine" is just as good as the single; "Bewildered" even surpasses the original version; and letting Bootsy loose on the "Give It Up Or Turn It Loose" groove is a bit like setting a fox in a chicken run.

Hot Pants
Polydor CD 1988
(orig. Polydor LP 1971)

Brown left King after Sex Machine. Hot Pants was his first album for Polydor, and if it is also his finest funk-era album, it is principally by default.
